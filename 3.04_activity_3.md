# 3.04 Activity 3

In the table below you can find a `Movie-Ticket` relation which provides the data about the movie tickets bought by customers.

Identify the functional dependencies in the relation.

- Is this relation in `1NF`, `2NF`, `3NF`, `BCNF`, and why?
- If not, show your steps of performing the normalization to transform the relation into `1NF`, `2NF`, `3NF`, and `BCNF`.
- Show all referential integrity constraints in the relational model that results from the normalization.
